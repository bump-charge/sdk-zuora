# Zuora.Model.GooglePay

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**card** | [**GetCardList**](GetCardList.md) | Credit card information. When providing a card number, you must meet the requirements for PCI compliance. We strongly recommend using Zuora.js instead of interacting with this API directly. | [optional] 
**token** | **string** | A gateway unique identifier that replaces sensitive payment method data or represents a gateway&#39;s unique customer profile. When &#x60;token&#x60; is used to represent a customer profile, &#x60;second_token&#x60; is conditionally required for representing the underlying tokenized payment method. | [optional]
